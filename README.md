**Task**:
Using data from the following publicly available graphQL endpoint:
1. https://countries.trevorblades.com/
2. https://github.com/trevorblades/countries
   
Build a simple web application that displays an interactive map with country data using NextJS. There
   are no architectural or UX / UI constraints other than to use React. It is up to you to decide how to
   tackle this problem.

**Instructions**: 
* Run `npm install` in console
* To start the application in development mode, use `npm run dev`
* To start the application in production mode, use `npm run build`, then `npm run start`
* To check on tests, use `npm test`. To check on tests coverage, use `npm run coverage`
